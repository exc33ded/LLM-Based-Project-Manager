# Advanced-Project-Manager-for-AMU

## Overview

**Advanced-Project-Manager-for-AMU** is a multi-role project management system with authentication and verification features. It allows users to manage multiple projects, generate tasks, and track progress while leveraging AI for enhanced project summaries and task management. Each project has its own memory-based chat feature, allowing for efficient project-specific communication and task delegation.

## Features

- **User Authentication and Verification**: Secure login system using user ID for authentication and verification.
- **Multi-Role System**: Supports various roles such as admin, project manager, and worker, each with specific permissions.
- **Task Generation and Management**: The system generates tasks that represent worker progress, making it easy to track and manage project workflows.
- **Project Summary Generation**: Each project has an AI-generated summary that helps manage tasks and guides the user.
- **Memory-Based Chat**: Projects come with a built-in chat application that retains the conversation history, helping users communicate and manage projects more effectively.
- **Unique Project Memory**: Each project retains its own memory, allowing for unique interactions based on the specific project's history and needs.

## How It Works

1. **User Verification**: After logging in, users are authenticated using their user ID.
2. **Project Creation**: Users can create projects, each identified by a unique combination of user ID and project ID.
3. **Task and Project Management**: Users can generate tasks, manage them, and use AI to provide project summaries that guide task execution.
4. **Project-Specific Memory**: Each project has its own memory-based chat feature, allowing users to communicate specifically for that project, with the system retaining the project's history.
5. **AI Interaction**: The AI uses the project summary to manage tasks, providing intelligent recommendations and tracking progress efficiently.
