# Advanced-Project-Manager-for-AMU

## Overview

**Advanced-Project-Manager-for-AMU** is a multi-role project management system with authentication and verification features. It allows users to manage multiple projects, generate tasks, and track progress while leveraging AI for enhanced project summaries and task management. Each project has its own memory-based chat feature, allowing for efficient project-specific communication and task delegation.

## Features

- **User Authentication and Verification**: Secure login system using user ID for authentication and verification.
- **Multi-Role System**: Supports various roles such as admin, project manager, and worker, each with specific permissions.
- **Task Generation and Management**: The system generates tasks that represent worker progress, making it easy to track and manage project workflows.
- **Project Summary Generation**: Each project has an AI-generated summary that helps manage tasks and guides the user.
- **Memory-Based Chat**: Projects come with a built-in chat application that retains the conversation history, helping users communicate and manage projects more effectively.
- **Unique Project Memory**: Each project retains its own memory, allowing for unique interactions based on the specific project's history and needs.

## How It Works

1. **User Verification**: After logging in, users are authenticated using their user ID.
2. **Project Creation**: Users can create projects, each identified by a unique combination of user ID and project ID.
3. **Task and Project Management**: Users can generate tasks, manage them, and use AI to provide project summaries that guide task execution.
4. **Project-Specific Memory**: Each project has its own memory-based chat feature, allowing users to communicate specifically for that project, with the system retaining the project's history.
5. **AI Interaction**: The AI uses the project summary to manage tasks, providing intelligent recommendations and tracking progress efficiently.

## Setting up the .env file

To configure the project, you need to set up a `.env` file with the required environment variables. This file contains sensitive information such as API keys and database credentials, which are necessary for the project to function correctly.

Steps to Set Up the `.env` File

1. Copy the example file
The project includes a `.env.example` file as a template. Copy it to create your `.env` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Edit the `.env` file
Open the `.env` file in a text editor and fill in the values for the following environment variables. Below is an example based on the project's requirements:

```bash
# AI API Keys (for project summary generation and task management)
GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key-here"
GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-api-key-here"
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="your-langchain-api-key-here"
GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key-here"

# LangSmith Configuration (for tracing and project management)
LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT=https://api.smith.langchain.com
LANGSMITH_API_KEY="your-langsmith-api-key-here"
LANGSMITH_PROJECT="your-project-name"

# Email Configuration (for notifications or authentication)
MAIL_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USE_TLS=True
MAIL_USERNAME="your-email-username-here"
MAIL_PASSWORD="your-email-password-here-generated"
```

**Important:** Replace the placeholder values (e.g., your-gemini-api-key-here) with your actual API keys and credentials. Do not use the example values directly, as they are for demonstration purposes only.
